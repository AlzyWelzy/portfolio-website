        After completing my 12th grade with a specialization in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">PCM</span>, I decided to follow my passion
        for programming by choosing BCA as my major, where I honed my skills in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          Python, Django and PostgreSQL
        </span>
        . I am also familiar with HTMX and HyperScript. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> as a software
        developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy playing
        video games, watching movies, and reading comics. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about <span className="font-medium">finance and history</span>.
        I'm also learning how to swim.
